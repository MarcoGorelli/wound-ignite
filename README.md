# Prize-winning submission to the M6 competition

Hello everybody

Here's a repo which I used to make submissions to the [M6 Forecasting Competition](https://m6competition.com).

If you check the file `how-to-submit.md`, that'll show the steps I went through each month.

For the last three months, for the investment part, I just put everything in the `DRE` stock, as by then it had become constant.

I'll put together a proper write-up, but for now here's everything I used!

## Why 'wound-ignite'?

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/microprediction/precise. GitHub doesn't allow for private forks, so
I had to push to a new repo with a differet name. `wound-ignite` is what some random name generator gave me.
Unfortunately, I don't have a better story.
